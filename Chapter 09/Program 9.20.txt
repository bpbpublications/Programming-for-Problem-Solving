// Program 9.20 for printing GP series
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a,n,d,i,x;
    printf("Enter the first term of the series: ");
    scanf("%d",&a);
    printf("Enter the common ratio of the series: ");
    scanf("%d",&d);
    printf("Enter the number of terms to be taken out: ");

    	a=(a*d);
    }

Output:

Enter the first term of the series: 1
Enter the common ratio of the series: 2
Enter the number of terms to be taken out: 5
 1       2       4       8       16
