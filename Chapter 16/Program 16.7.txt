// Program 16.7 prints an array using a pointer
#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int a[] = {10,20 ,30, 40, 50};
    int *p;
    p = &a;
    int i;
    for(i = 0; i < 5; i++)

Output:
The element on a[0] is = 10
The address of a[0] element is = 6422016
The element on a[1] is = 20
The address of a[1] element is = 6422020
The element on a[2] is = 30
The address of a[2] element is = 6422024
The element on a[3] is = 40
The address of a[3] element is = 6422028
The element on a[4] is = 50
The address of a[4] element is = 6422032
