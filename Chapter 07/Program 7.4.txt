// Program 7.4 to illustrate relational operators
#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
    int a = 7;
    int b = 2;
    if( a == b )
    		printf("a and b are equal");
    if( a != b )
    		printf("\n a and b are not equal");
    if( a > b )
    		printf("\n a is greater than b");
    if( a < b )
    		printf("\n a is less than b");
    if( a <= b )
    		printf("\n a is less or equal to b");
    if( a >= b )
    		printf("\n a is greater than or equal to  b", a,b);
}

Output:

 a and b are not equal
 a is greater than b
 a is greater than or equal to  b
