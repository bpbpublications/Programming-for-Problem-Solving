// Program 7.1 illustrates arithmetic operators
#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int a = 7,b = 2;
    printf("The sum of a and b = %d \n", a+b);
    printf("The difference between a and b = %d \n", a-b);
    printf("The product of a and b = %d \n", a*b);
    printf("The division of a and b  = %d \n", a/b);
    printf("a mode b = %d \n", a%b);
}

Output:

The sum of a and b = 9
The difference between a and b = 5
The product of a and b = 14
The division of a and b  = 3
a mode b = 1
