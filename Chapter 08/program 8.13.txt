//Program 8.13 to check whether a number is divisible by other number or not
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int a,b;
printf("Enter the first number: ");
scanf("%d",&a);
printf("Enter the second number: ");
scanf("%d",&b);
if(a%b==0)
printf("a is divisible by b");
else
printf("a is not divisible by b");
return 0;
}

Output:

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
a is divisible by b
